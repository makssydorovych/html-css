<!-- 34 Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on

	<!-- 38 To begin, apply the monospace font to the h2 element, so that it now has two fonts - Lobster and monospace.

In the last challenge, you imported the Lobster font using the link tag. Now comment out that import of the Lobster font (using the HTML comments you learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore. Notice how your h2 element degrades to the monospace font.

Note: If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the degradation because your browser is able to find the font. -->
	h2 {
	font-family: Lobster, monospace;

	<!-- 39 Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide. -->
	.smaller-image{
	width: 100px;
	}
	<!-- 40 Create a class called thick-green-border. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo.

 Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:
 
 <img class="class1 class2"> -->
	.thick-green-border {
	border: 10px solid green;
	}
