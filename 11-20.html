<!-- Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to #footer and the text from cat photos to Jump to Bottom.
Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.
Then add an id attribute with a value of footer to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page. -->
